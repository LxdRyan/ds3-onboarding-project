# Project Description: Collaborative To-Do List Web App

The goal is to create a web application that allows users to manage a shared to-do list. The app should enable adding, viewing, updating, and deleting tasks, with the data persisting across sessions. The project must be managed using Git for version control and Docker for containerization.

## Application Architecture

This project requires implementing a multi-component application with:

### 1. Frontend Component
- Web-based user interface accessible via browser
- Responsible for displaying tasks and providing interactive elements
- Communicates with the backend via API calls

### 2. Backend Component
- Server application that handles business logic
- Provides API endpoints for the frontend to consume
- Processes task creation, updates, and deletions
- Communicates with the database for persistence

### 3. Database Component
- Stores task data persistently
- Allows data to survive application restarts
- Should be containerized along with the other components

### 4. Docker Infrastructure
- Each component should be containerized separately
- Docker Compose should be used to define and run the multi-container application
- Network configuration to allow components to communicate with each other

## Requirements

- **Core Functionality**
  - Users can add a new task with a description.
  - Users can view a list of all existing tasks.
  - Users can mark a task as complete or incomplete.
  - Users can delete a task.
  - Task data persists (e.g., stored somewhere, not just in memory).

- **User Interface**
  - The app has a web-based interface accessible via a browser.
  - The interface displays the task list in a readable format.
  - There are input mechanisms (e.g., buttons, forms) to add, update, and delete tasks.
  - The design is functional (no need for advanced styling, but must be usable).

- **Git Usage**
  - The project is stored in a single Git repository.
  - Each digispec creates at least one branch for their contributions.
  - Changes are merged into a main branch via pull requests or similar workflow.

- **Docker Usage**
  - Components of the app are containerized.
  - The app in its entirety can be set up with docker compose.

- **Collaboration**
  - The team divides responsibilities to complete the project.
  - Evidence of teamwork exists in the Git history (e.g., merged branches, comments).
  - The final product integrates all contributions into a working whole.

- **Documentation**
  - A README file with setup instructions

## Detailed Functionality Specifications
- these are suggestions, you can design the app as you see fit

### Task Management
- **Task Creation**
  - A form with a text input field for task description
  - Submit button to add the task to the list
  - Priority level selection (High, Medium, Low)
  - Due date selection via date picker
  - Form validation to prevent empty submissions

- **Task Display**
  - List view showing all tasks with their current status
  - Each task shows: description, completion status, creation date
  - Tasks should be visually distinguishable (complete vs. incomplete)
  - Sort tasks by creation date, completion status, or priority
  - Filter tasks by status (All, Active, Completed)

- **Task Updates**
  - Checkbox or toggle button to mark tasks as complete/incomplete
  - Visual indication of task completion (e.g., strikethrough, color change)
  - Edit button to modify task description after creation
  - Ability to update task priority or due date

- **Task Deletion**
  - Delete button for each task
  - Confirmation dialog before deletion
  - Bulk delete option for completed tasks

## Achievement Ladder

Each tier builds upon the previous one, creating a clear path to follow.

### Tier 1: Getting Started üöÄ
**Mission**: Set up the project structure and get familiar with the tools.

**Checkpoints**:
- [x] Initialize a Git repository with a README
- [x] Create a simple frontend web page that displays a static list of tasks
- [x] Set up a basic backend server that can respond to requests
- [x] Create Dockerfiles for both frontend and backend components
- [x] Each team member makes at least one commit

**Victory Condition**: Show a working frontend and backend running in separate containers, even if they don't communicate yet.

### Tier 2: Not badüîß
**Mission**: Implement core functionality with proper component communication.

**Checkpoints**:
- [x] Set up a database component (can be a simple JSON file to start)
- [x] Create API endpoints in the backend for basic CRUD operations
- [x] Connect the frontend to the backend API
- [ ] Implement task creation and viewing in the UI
- [ ] Implement task completion toggling and deletion
- [ ] Create feature branches for different components/functionality
- [x] Set up Docker Compose to run all components together
- [ ] Update README with basic setup instructions

**Victory Condition**: Demonstrate a functional to-do app with all components working together, where tasks persist between page refreshes.

### Tier 3: Pretty goodüëç
**Mission**: Polish the application and demonstrate effective teamwork across components.

**Checkpoints**:
- [ ] Implement a clean, intuitive UI with proper styling
- [ ] Add task filtering (All, Active, Completed) in the frontend
- [ ] Enhance the backend with proper error handling and validation
- [x] Upgrade to a more robust database solution if using a simple file
- [ ] Ensure data persistence is robust (survives container restarts)
- [x] Establish a proper Git workflow with meaningful commit messages
- [x] Optimize Docker configuration (appropriate base images, port mapping)
- [x] Each team member contributes to different components
- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation including architecture diagram

**Victory Condition**: Present a polished application with all three components (frontend, backend, database) working together seamlessly.

### Tier 4: Chad Status ‚ú®
**Mission**: Extend the application with advanced features across all components.

**Checkpoints**:
- [ ] Implement priority levels for tasks (UI + API + database schema)
- [ ] Add due dates with visual indicators
- [ ] Create task categories or tags
- [ ] Implement bulk actions (delete completed, mark all as complete)
- [ ] Add real-time updates between users (e.g., WebSockets)
- [ ] Implement proper API authentication/security
- [ ] Optimize Docker for production (multi-stage builds, environment variables)
- [ ] Add automated tests for frontend and backend components
- [ ] Implement database migrations or schema versioning

**Victory Condition**: Showcase an application with advanced features that demonstrates technical excellence across all components.

### Tier 5: Gigachad Status üèÜ
**Mission**: Transform the project into a production-ready application.

**Checkpoints**:
- [ ] Implement user accounts or session management
- [ ] Add collaborative features (assigned tasks, comments)
- [ ] Create a responsive design that works on different screen sizes
- [ ] Implement keyboard shortcuts and accessibility features
- [ ] Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing/deployment
- [ ] Implement database backups and recovery procedures
- [ ] Add performance monitoring and logging across components
- [ ] Deploy the application to a cloud provider
- [ ] Create a compelling demo with example scenarios
- [ ] Document the team's journey and lessons learned

**Victory Condition**: Deliver a near-production quality application with professional architecture and workflows.

## Notes
- Reaching Tier 2 is a solid achievement, and Tier 3 is excellent for a one-week project.
- Focus on learning and collaboration rather than rushing through features.
- Document your progress and challenges throughout the project.
- Presentation at the end of project
